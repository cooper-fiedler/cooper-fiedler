I’m @cooper-fiedler

I’m interested in software engineering, mountain biking, fly fishing, rock climbing, and traveling.

I’m currently learning Spring Security for Java web apps, lead climbing techniques for certification, and how to do my own electrical work at my house.

I’m looking to collaborate on Spring Java Projects, gaming plugins, and anything else that will grow my understanding of the Java world.
